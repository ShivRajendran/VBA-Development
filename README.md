# VBA-Development

For all folders Readme word documents are present explaining the purpose of the VBA coding and how it worked.
Pictures for output results and user interface of prgram are present since excel files that hosted the programs
were too big to really make sense to upload.

For VBA code rather than using object notations I preferred to refer to each different nuance of excel by name. For example, rather than naming worksheets or pictures/graphs as objects i prefered to code by using Worksheets(1).range("A2").value or ChartObject(1). I found it easier to use exact references when using VBA because the code was little easier to follow.

When using VBA I typically kept in mind the user interface and how users would be able to use my programs after I left the company. My programs were generally user friendly and had textboxes and msgboxes to aid them through use of the program. I also utilized dictionaries which are pretty much hashtables since they were the only advanced data structures other than arrays, and 2-D arrays VBA implements.
