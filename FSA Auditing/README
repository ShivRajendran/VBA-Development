This Macro checks if EMployee FSA payments have been deducted properly. A report is run that contains employee data and how much they should be paying into FSA. The actual deductions is another worksheet. The Macro compares actual deducted per month per employee to what should have been deducted and flags overcahrges or undercharges. Macro 3 is purely for styling of the final product.
